# 🏦 Loan Prediction Using Machine Learning  

## Overview  
This project focuses on predicting **loan approval status** using machine learning. It utilizes classification models to analyze applicant details and determine loan approval likelihood. The dataset is preprocessed, visualized, and trained using **Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression** models.  

## Features  
✅ Data preprocessing: handling missing values, encoding categorical variables.  
✅ Exploratory data analysis (EDA): visualizing relationships using **Seaborn & Matplotlib**.  
✅ Feature engineering: correlation analysis and feature selection.  
✅ Model training: **Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression**.  
✅ Model evaluation: **Accuracy Score, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report**.  

## Installation  
Clone the repository and install dependencies:  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/loan-prediction.git
cd loan-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset  
- **Training Data**: `train_u6lujuX_CVtuZ9i.csv`  
- **Testing Data**: `test_Y3wMUE5_7gLdaTN.csv`  

## Running the Model  
To train and test the loan prediction model:  
```sh
python loan_prediction_using_ml.py
```

## Model Performance  
The models are evaluated based on accuracy and classification reports:  
📌 **Decision Tree**: Accuracy ≈ 75%  
📌 **Random Forest**: Accuracy ≈ 82%  
📌 **Logistic Regression**: Accuracy ≈ 76%  

## Future Improvements
